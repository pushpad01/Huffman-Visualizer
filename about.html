            <h3>How to use</h3>
            <p>
              There are multiple ways to use our Huffman Encoding Visualizer.
              First, is to simply type your input into the text box, and watch
              the tree, bits, and compression percentage dynamically change with
              each character. Or, if you want, you can drag and drop a text file
              into the text box, and the Visualizer will automatically populate
              the text field, as well as build the tree, display the bits, and
              show the compression percentage for the file you dropped. After
              doing either of these, if you want to keep the encoding that you
              just created, you can click on the "Download" button, and your
              browser will initiate a download of the encoded file. However,
              your typical text editor will not be able to correctly interpret
              this file, because of its encoding. If you wish to see the decoded
              contents of your encoded file, you may drag and drop the file into
              the bits display box, or use the "Upload" button, and like magic,
              everything will be populated!
            </p>

            <h3>How it works</h3>
            <p>
              Using the input from the user, we build a Huffman Tree. This is a
              binary tree where each leaf represents a unique character from the
              input. For more information on constructing a Huffman Tree,
              <a href="huffman_tutorial.html" target="_blank"
                >read this article</a
              >. Once this is done, we use the structure of the tree to map each
              unique character to a specific encoding. These encodings are then
              used in conjunction with the user input to create the series of
              bits that represents the input. Metadata is constructed using the
              character mappings, and then added to an array in preparation for
              writing to a file. The series of bits is divided into one byte
              chunks, and appended to the array, completing the download file.
              When an encoded file is uploaded, the process is essentially
              reversed. The mapping metadata is used to reconstruct the user
              input from the bit series, and then that input is used once again
              to reconstruct the tree. The compression percentage is calculated
              by subtracting the size of the encoded file divided by what would
              have been the size of the plain text file from one, and displayed
              in a nifty bar below the output.

            <h3>About this project</h3>
            <p>
              I always feel fascinated by the new algorithms and their functioning.
              When I was learning the Huffman encoding, I felt a little difficulty
              in understanding it. When I learned it, I decided to build a dynamic
              representation of this algorithm. I have got help from pre-existing
              projects on the internet and here is the final output.
